# Code Against Trump

Post-election there's been a groundswell of data + tech people interested in using their skills to work against Trump's America. New groups are emerging to do just that. And, of course, there are a number of civic tech groups that have done this sort of work for years. It can be hard to keep track. This is a list of volunteer-based groups that use data and technology to improve American communities and work against Trump's vision of America. 

**This list is not comprehensive. Please add to it! Submit a pull request or issue.**

**Nonpartisan groups are including on this list and their inclusion does not imply a political stance.** 

## An Important Note
Data and technology is but one part of a very large toolbox in fighting back. Please check out websites like [Holy Fuck. Now What?](http://www.holyfucktheelection.com/) and [political-resources](https://valeriecodes.github.io/political-resources/) on other ways to volunteer time or money (and help grow [each](https://github.com/csb324/holyfucktheelectionistomorrow) [list](https://github.com/valeriecodes/political-resources), respectively). Many of the groups below are predominantly focused on data and tech but invite people from all skillsets and levels of expertise.
