# Code Against Trump

Post-election there's been a groundswell of data + tech people interested in using their skills to work against Trump's America. New groups are emerging to do just that. And, of course, there are a number of civic tech groups that have done this sort of work for years. It can be hard to keep track. This is a list of volunteer-based groups that use data and technology to improve American communities and work against Trump's vision of America. 

**This list is not comprehensive. Please add to it! Submit a pull request or issue.**
